<p>My project was inspired by my interest in historical AI techniques as well as my introduction to Bayesian networks via the Artificial Intelligence class. I wanted to use the opportunity of this class to focus my (initially vague) research interest into a concrete project that would allow me to learn practical development skills, modern Python library usage and project management best practices, and explore the current state of the field and its relationship to the broader AI research field.</p>

<ul>
<li>Multiple dataset selection</li>
</ul>
<p>Just the example datasets included with bnlearn for now, but began scaffolding to implement adding new datasets using a simple dataset registry with json with tags. Endpoint for listing available datasets, which will be expanded to display more statistics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Comparison endpoint</li>
</ul>
<p>Gives results from multiple specified discovery algorithms in a convenient report, so far just with pure algorithmic discovery. This isn&rsquo;t that useful for many datasets; I will need to add functionality for incorporating domain knowledge constraints, which is more practically useful.</p>

            <h1 id="week-8-update">Week 8 Update</h1>
<h2 id="this-week">This week</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added sections to my project org file documenting installaton prerequisites (eg. I had to install the <code>libgraphviz-pkg</code> on my system to get the <code>cgraph.h</code> library rather than the <code>graphviz</code> package) as well as errors that I encounter and their fixes. This will help me with my final README targeted to users wishing to use my code as well as &ldquo;future me.&rdquo; It will also help me create a Dockerfile or similar in the future.</li>
<li>Discovered <code>bnlearn</code> python package (not the R one, which also seems good; I don&rsquo;t know if they are affiliated). It seems to be quite actively maintained and has a lot of helpful introductory material. It has an accessible API and good documentation which has made a lot of the implementation easier. However, this leaves me feeling like I will have to expand the scope of my project in some way, as a lot of my functions can be now reduced to a few lines of standard <code>model.fit; plot(model)</code> type code; I don&rsquo;t exactly mind having this problem, as it opens up the possibility to explore higher level ideas.</li>
<li>Implemented basic discovery model usage with Sachs (2005) dataset</li>
<li>Added more directory/module structure and stub files for planning/organization</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="next-week">Next week</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continue to implement basic features of API with</li>
<li>Research and begin to implement more interesting combinations of algorithms (averaging models, meta-analysis, etc.) to implement in the API.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="obstacles">Obstacles</h2>
<ul>
<li>More dependency compatibility issues and changing APIs: quite a few of the relevant packages are in their 0.xx stage of development and have changed their dependency requirements and/or APIs since available example code has been written. Some of them seem to have been effectively abandoned with nothing to make this clear to prospective users, leading to wasted time trying to get them set up. Thankfully, the functionality I need seems to exist in newer, maintained packages.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="process">Process</h2>
<p>The project update and the feedback I received really helped me feel more focused and directional this week. I think that iteratively creating project structure with directories and stubs and filling them out with implementation is helping me to stay congizant of where I am going while I am working and is helping me to avoid getting lost in unfocused exploration and/or stuck not knowing where to go next. I am also enjoying the process of using notebooks to explore/document, then moving that code to a more structured system.</p>

<ul>
<li>Decided on pytest for testing framework. Refamiliarized self with pytest and created initial test stub.</li>
<li>Refined scope of project to basic inference topics with a focus on causal discovery methods</li>
<li>Began design of discovery API with plans for data validation with Pydantic</li>
<li>Implementated basic discovery method for data pairs (ie. given the assumption that one variable is causal and one is an effect, which one is which? and give measures of certainty)</li>
<li>Added to learning resources page</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="next-week">Next Week</h2>
<ul>
<li>experiment with causal discovery algorithms on more complex datasets</li>
<li>formalize API design more and begin documentation</li>
<li>add more methods/library choices to API</li>
<li>write more extensive tests</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impediments-and-process">Impediments and Process</h2>
<p>I got more done this week by focusing on learning about high-level practical tasks above theoretical knowledge or implementation details. I do feel as though I lack some understanding of the things I implemented through library APIs, so I would not really feel confident asserting anything in particular about the results I am acheiving. I do feel like this is worthwhile though, as having a tangible program starting to take shape acts as motivation to go back and learn in more detail what it is doing and how I can refine and improve the results.</p>
