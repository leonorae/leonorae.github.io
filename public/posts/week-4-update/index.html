<meta name="description" content="Knowledge Update I learned about the overall process of creating a causal model, estimation of causal effect, inference, refutation tests.
I learned that the causal diagram is essentially a prior assumption that is somewhat subjective. This reinforces my prior assumption that I should choose a relatively well understood, normalized, and simple dataset(s), because it would be difficult to generalize and construct complex causal models for domains I am speculating about.
I was very curious about the idea of &ldquo;discovering&rdquo; causal effects from essentially unstructured data, but I will assume that this is not a basic topic and leave it to research after this project has helped me to understand the basics.
