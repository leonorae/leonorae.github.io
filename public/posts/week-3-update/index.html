<p>My personal website is up at leonorae.github.io, but I need to add more of the required pages, which I will work on this week.</p>
<p>This week I will also do some &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; type examples with the packages mentioned above as well as some groundwork theoretical research and present some examples from both in a post.</p>
<p>My main impediments at this time are organizational, I need to outline my time and schedule around heavy weeks in Systems.</p>
<p>I can improve my process this week by organizing my time in regards to working on my project and doing &ldquo;logistical&rdquo; things such as reflecting on my work in posts more efficiently.</p>
