I ran into a seemingly unresolvable dependency issue between CausalNex and DoWhy. I have decided to leave causalnex to the side for now, as dowhy seems more useful and important to understand. I will still investigate it in a different virtual environment and write some of my thoughts on how it compares to dowhy, but I will use this as an opportunity to focus the scope of my project.</p>
<p>As I expected, the subject matter is complex and fully understanding all of the material within the semester is not feasible. I spent a lot of time this week in introductory subject material, I believe this was a good idea because of the importance of fundamental knowledge, but it is not sustainable to treat this project like a full causal inference class. My structured learning plan will help me stay focused and only devote significant time to learning things I really need to understand for this project.</p>
<h3 id="process">Process<a href="#process" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>I feel better and better about my process as I become more organized and the scope narrows. I still need to define the endpoint of my project more, but I think that will be very possible this week. I think this week I will dive into the code a bit more before reading too much theory and try to &ldquo;backfill&rdquo; my understanding after implementing something to avoid getting stuck trying to fully understand something&rsquo;s implementation details.</p>
