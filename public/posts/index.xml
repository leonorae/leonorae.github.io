&lt;p&gt;My project was inspired by my interest in historical AI techniques as well as my introduction to Bayesian networks via the Artificial Intelligence class. I wanted to use the opportunity of this class to focus my (initially vague) research interest into a concrete project that would allow me to learn practical development skills, modern Python library usage and project management best practices, and explore the current state of the field and its relationship to the broader AI research field.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;My project was inspired by my interest in historical AI techniques as well as my introduction to Bayesian networks via the Artificial Intelligence class. I wanted to use the opportunity of this class to focus my (initially vague) research interest into a concrete project that would allow me to learn practical development skills, modern Python library usage and project management best practices, and explore the current state of the field and its relationship to the broader AI research field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider this project important to my professional development as an AI researcher and AI-enabled software developer because it is related to explainable/interpretable AI, one of my main research interests. I want to be able to quickly pick up an understanding of a technical subfield and explore and evaluate whether it contains potential for new and unexpected developments, not just follow popular research trends. At the very least, I would like a precise understanding of the limitations of currently-considered &amp;ldquo;dead ends&amp;rdquo; in AI research, both to avoid recreating them and to spur alternative approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;original-project-goals&#34;&gt;Original Project Goals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement a basic causal inference pipeline with example data using causal
inference python packages. Document experience and reasoning for choices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outcome: gain knowledge of the state of existing causal inference packages
(egs. DoWhy, CausalNex, EconML)
in python, including tradeoffs/benefits of packages not used for the implementation
of the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a basic API for the pipeline using &lt;code&gt;fastapi&lt;/code&gt;. Verify that it works with
tests. Keep it updated as the pipeline and data change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outcome: gain experience with API implementation and maintenence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a more advanced causal inference pipeline with a real world (or
synthetic approximation) dataset and additional functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outcome: gain knowledge of causal inference techniques and results,
research experience, and development experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;methodology-materials-and-methods&#34;&gt;Methodology, Materials and Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My methodology was to combine learning the theory, research, and development into a continuous process. I began by looking for general introductory material (textbooks, explainers, etc.), explored the basics using available packages and code (while evaluating my experience with them), and used my new understanding to hone my research approach. I would also use my research to guide my learning and development, if I encountered an interesting idea in a paper that was beyond my current level of understanding I would determine which knowledge I lacked, what prerequisites I needed to get there, how I could explore it in code, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important part of my methodology, facilitated by the requirements of this class, was to document my experience and the resources I acquired as I went. I also continuously documented questions and further research ideas I had as I went, so I could maintain a balance of staying focused at the task at hand while being exploratory, rather than constantly going down new rabbit holes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main theoretical knowledge gain from this project was simply clarifying what the basic categories of causal reasoning task were and their methods, relationships to other tasks, and limitations. Before doing the project this was all muddy to me; I understood the general ideas of structure learning and inference but wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite sure what the boundaries were, or quite what the significance of their results was. I also gained a better understanding of causal reasoning&amp;rsquo;s relationship to data science and AI, particularly applications to reinforcement learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met all of my basic project goals. I am confident that I have investigated the majority of existing causal inference/discovery packages in Python, and have a good idea of which are the most complete and actively developed, as well as a feeling for their differences. I also got some idea of the ecosystem outside of Python, including R and Java. I implemented causal discovery and inference methods with them and used tests (pytest) to verify the endpoints. The API has Pydtantic verification and typing features. I gained experience implementing an async/background job system with a database, ORM/schema, with FastAPI. The program has a clean architectural separation between the API, discovery logic, and background services. I explored various canonical datasets with my API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;discussion--reflection&#34;&gt;Discussion / Reflection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met all of my original project goals to an extent, but I would by no means consider myself an expert in the material nor particularly skilled at FastAPI etc. development as a result of this project. The biggest criticism I would have of my own project is that it somewhat lacks a practical identity or purpose, it does not provide much functionality beyond a API/server wrapper with some combination of libraries and streamlined functions. I did not have time to go particularly deep into any research area nor explore any &amp;ldquo;cutting edge&amp;rdquo; areas such as implementing novel algorithms described in papers. In the context of this particular class it was a good compromise of practicality and exploring my interests, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think that I would necessarily do something like it again. In the future, I think that I could benefit from a cleaner separation between exploration/research and focused &amp;ldquo;product&amp;rdquo; projects. For example, if I had done a more general/directed FastAPI project first, I may have gained those skills faster rather than dealing with the particularities of another library I was learning at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think that the experience was good for my development simply for the experience of going through a project cycle and documenting it, I developed a lot of new methods for recording and presenting my progress, self-evaluating, and exploratory research. One of the main things that I learned was both the utility and extreme difficulty of setting concrete and attainable goals in a space that I do not fully understand the scope of. I do not feel that any of my attempts at prescribing a weekly plan adhered to what happened, but there was still utility in setting them. A couple of the (minor) goals that I set in my project update were not met because simply I did not realize that they were not applicable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is certainly a lot to be added if I want a coherent portfolio piece, I think that I have arrived at a good stopping point for the project in terms of this class and have a good idea about next steps and potential future research ideas if I choose to pursue them or a deeper understanding of this field in the future. I think that my new awareness of causal methods in RL will be a good pathway back into that subject for me. Most importantly, I feel that I have refined my self-guided research process in a useful way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Multiple dataset selection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just the example datasets included with bnlearn for now, but began scaffolding to implement adding new datasets using a simple dataset registry with json with tags. Endpoint for listing available datasets, which will be expanded to display more statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comparison endpoint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gives results from multiple specified discovery algorithms in a convenient report, so far just with pure algorithmic discovery. This isn&amp;rsquo;t that useful for many datasets; I will need to add functionality for incorporating domain knowledge constraints, which is more practically useful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Began Final Report&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Began outlining topics to cover in final report, mainly the high-level conceptual topics I have researched about how causality relates to the AI field more broadly. Main topic of research recently has been the relationship and subtle differences between causality and RL. In a sense, the Bellman equation learns causal knowledge through the agent&amp;rsquo;s actions. The most obvious difference is that RL is mostly an online process, but causality learns from statistical relationships in observed data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;next-week&#34;&gt;Next Week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polish and expand API features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More robust testing and verification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further research on open research problems (mainly relation to interpretable models / agent explainability) to write about in report, possibly with code as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean up and remove old dependencies from requirements, test reproducibility of dependencies and environment on other machines, look into containerization if time/necessary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;impediments&#34;&gt;Impediments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now my main impediment with the project is the large gap between simply applying causal discovery and inference methods to data and more interesting research questions. I doubt I will have enough time to explore them with this project, so I will focus on creating a minimal finished product and learning more about the frameworks and libraries that I am using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;process&#34;&gt;Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that streamlining my environment and dependency management more will make a big difference, as right now I can only work on the project directly from one computer, which obviously isn&amp;rsquo;t ideal, and would make working in a team very difficult. I should have taken more care from the start with this, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think that it will be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Week 8 Update</title>
      <link>https://leonorae.github.io/posts/week-8-update/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 17:05:32 -0500</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;week-8-update&#34;&gt;Week 8 Update&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;this-week&#34;&gt;This week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added sections to my project org file documenting installaton prerequisites (eg. I had to install the &lt;code&gt;libgraphviz-pkg&lt;/code&gt; on my system to get the &lt;code&gt;cgraph.h&lt;/code&gt; library rather than the &lt;code&gt;graphviz&lt;/code&gt; package) as well as errors that I encounter and their fixes. This will help me with my final README targeted to users wishing to use my code as well as &amp;ldquo;future me.&amp;rdquo; It will also help me create a Dockerfile or similar in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discovered &lt;code&gt;bnlearn&lt;/code&gt; python package (not the R one, which also seems good; I don&amp;rsquo;t know if they are affiliated). It seems to be quite actively maintained and has a lot of helpful introductory material. It has an accessible API and good documentation which has made a lot of the implementation easier. However, this leaves me feeling like I will have to expand the scope of my project in some way, as a lot of my functions can be now reduced to a few lines of standard &lt;code&gt;model.fit; plot(model)&lt;/code&gt; type code; I don&amp;rsquo;t exactly mind having this problem, as it opens up the possibility to explore higher level ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implemented basic discovery model usage with Sachs (2005) dataset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added more directory/module structure and stub files for planning/organization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;next-week&#34;&gt;Next week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue to implement basic features of API with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research and begin to implement more interesting combinations of algorithms (averaging models, meta-analysis, etc.) to implement in the API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obstacles&#34;&gt;Obstacles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More dependency compatibility issues and changing APIs: quite a few of the relevant packages are in their 0.xx stage of development and have changed their dependency requirements and/or APIs since available example code has been written. Some of them seem to have been effectively abandoned with nothing to make this clear to prospective users, leading to wasted time trying to get them set up. Thankfully, the functionality I need seems to exist in newer, maintained packages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;process&#34;&gt;Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project update and the feedback I received really helped me feel more focused and directional this week. I think that iteratively creating project structure with directories and stubs and filling them out with implementation is helping me to stay congizant of where I am going while I am working and is helping me to avoid getting lost in unfocused exploration and/or stuck not knowing where to go next. I am also enjoying the process of using notebooks to explore/document, then moving that code to a more structured system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;week-6-update&#34;&gt;Week 6 Update&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;this-week&#34;&gt;This Week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decided on pytest for testing framework. Refamiliarized self with pytest and created initial test stub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refined scope of project to basic inference topics with a focus on causal discovery methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Began design of discovery API with plans for data validation with Pydantic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementated basic discovery method for data pairs (ie. given the assumption that one variable is causal and one is an effect, which one is which? and give measures of certainty)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added to learning resources page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;next-week&#34;&gt;Next Week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;experiment with causal discovery algorithms on more complex datasets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;formalize API design more and begin documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add more methods/library choices to API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write more extensive tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;impediments-and-process&#34;&gt;Impediments and Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got more done this week by focusing on learning about high-level practical tasks above theoretical knowledge or implementation details. I do feel as though I lack some understanding of the things I implemented through library APIs, so I would not really feel confident asserting anything in particular about the results I am acheiving. I do feel like this is worthwhile though, as having a tangible program starting to take shape acts as motivation to go back and learn in more detail what it is doing and how I can refine and improve the results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;li&gt;formalize API design more and begin documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add more methods/library choices to API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write more extensive tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;impediments-and-process&#34;&gt;Impediments and Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got more done this week by focusing on learning about high-level practical tasks above theoretical knowledge or implementation details. I do feel as though I lack some understanding of the things I implemented through library APIs, so I would not really feel confident asserting anything in particular about the results I am acheiving. I do feel like this is worthwhile though, as having a tangible program starting to take shape acts as motivation to go back and learn in more detail what it is doing and how I can refine and improve the results.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Week 5 Update</title>
      <link>https://leonorae.github.io/posts/week-5-update/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 20:57:45 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://leonorae.github.io/posts/week-5-update/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-week&#34;&gt;This Week&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I created a basic inference pipeline with the DoWhy tutorial&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I implemented a basic API with the fastAPI tutorial and made the results from the DoWhy tutorial accessible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I added a navigation menu and about page to my personal website, and some other minor updates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I added three posts containing the information I have compended so far on causal inference resources to make my research visible:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning resources (books, tutorials, papers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Datasets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python packages (will include personal thoughts and comparisons as I develop them)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learned important causal inference concepts, fundamental formulae (association vs. causation, bias, etc.), differences between methodologies and tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;next-week&#34;&gt;Next Week&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;choose testing framework and write initial tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;start exploring toy datasets and more interesting inference tasks, choose main dataset to focus on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;draft plan for API design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;refine resource pages, as right now they are drafts/lists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create structured learning plan (identify vital/fundamental study topics)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;impediments&#34;&gt;Impediments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent more time than I expected to with the venv setup and dependency problems, but this was a good opportunity to learn more about eg. setting up a pyproject.toml file. I ran into a seemingly unresolvable dependency issue between CausalNex and DoWhy. I have decided to leave causalnex to the side for now, as dowhy seems more useful and important to understand. I will still investigate it in a different virtual environment and write some of my thoughts on how it compares to dowhy, but I will use this as an opportunity to focus the scope of my project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I will still investigate it in a different virtual environment and write some of my thoughts on how it compares to dowhy, but I will use this as an opportunity to focus the scope of my project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I expected, the subject matter is complex and fully understanding all of the material within the semester is not feasible. I spent a lot of time this week in introductory subject material, I believe this was a good idea because of the importance of fundamental knowledge, but it is not sustainable to treat this project like a full causal inference class. My structured learning plan will help me stay focused and only devote significant time to learning things I really need to understand for this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;process&#34;&gt;Process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel better and better about my process as I become more organized and the scope narrows. I still need to define the endpoint of my project more, but I think that will be very possible this week. I think this week I will dive into the code a bit more before reading too much theory and try to &amp;ldquo;backfill&amp;rdquo; my understanding after implementing something to avoid getting stuck trying to fully understand something&amp;rsquo;s implementation details.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://leonorae.github.io/posts/week-4-update/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set up a repo and preliminary environment: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/leonorae/enter-causal&#34;&gt;https://github.com/leonorae/enter-causal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;while I have used venv and uv before, reinforced knowledge of environment setup with &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/codecodecode/uv-virtualenv-direnv-a-fast-reproducible-python-workflow-with-envrc-36da47ce1f4b&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gathered learning resources and learned high-level concepts of causal inference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;collected a set of “canonical” datasets for possible use later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;organized learning resources and notes, project goals and intermediate tasks, and detailed weekly plan, into a planning document&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete dowhy tutorial and implement a minimal pipeline of my own with synthetic/simple data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete a basic fastapi inference endpoint &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write basic tests &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update and expand personal website, maybe an overview/intro article if time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Process:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;This week I:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Write basic tests &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update and expand personal website, maybe an overview/intro article if time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was much more organized this week, and I feel like the project direction is clearer thanks to helpful feedback on my proposal. I need to follow my own advice of sticking to completing the set goal before going too far into research rabbitholes a little bit more, but next week’s goals are very tangible so it should be reasonably easy to complete them and still have time to brainstorm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;knowledge-update&#34;&gt;Knowledge Update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned about the overall process of creating a causal model, estimation of causal effect, inference, refutation tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://causalwizard.app/inference/article/causal-diagram&#34;&gt;causal diagram is essentially a prior assumption&lt;/a&gt; that is somewhat subjective. This reinforces my prior assumption that I should choose a relatively well understood, normalized, and simple dataset(s), because it would be difficult to generalize and construct complex causal models for domains I am speculating about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very curious about the idea of &amp;ldquo;discovering&amp;rdquo; causal effects from essentially unstructured data, but I will assume that this is not a basic topic and leave it to research after this project has helped me to understand the basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;code-update&#34;&gt;Code Update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Established that I will focus on using &lt;code&gt;dowhy&lt;/code&gt; first, implement &lt;code&gt;causalnex&lt;/code&gt; primarily as a comparison, use &lt;code&gt;econml&lt;/code&gt; for&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Project Proposal</title>
      <link>https://leonorae.github.io/posts/project-proposal/</link>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;causal-inference-pipeline-with-api&#34;&gt;Causal Inference Pipeline with API&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;vision-statement&#34;&gt;Vision Statement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Causal inference is a technique that is important in the history of artificial
intelligence. It is interested in finding causes and effects from data and
constructing causal models. It is a difficult problem for many reasons, including
the classic &amp;ldquo;coorelation does not imply causation&amp;rdquo; problem. A ground truth is often
difficult to find, and experimenting/gathering many kinds of data can be difficult
or impossible.
It is related to the field of econometrics, and is important to the medical field
in assessing causes of patient outcomes.
I would like to explore the current state of the field using Python libraries,
developing a basic pipeline and experimenting with various techniques and datasets,
and ultimately deliver a functional API.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to learn more about Bayes Nets and causal theory while gaining
practical software development experience. I would like to gain an understanding of
the available python packages related to these topics and be able to explain their
differences and compatabilities. I need to gain experience with project design and
management. I think it will be a good experience to document my project as I work
on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;goals--milestones&#34;&gt;Goals / Milestones&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement a basic causal inference pipeline with example data using causal
inference python packages. Document experience and reasoning for choices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outcome: gain knowledge of the state of existing causal inference packages
(egs. DoWhy, CausalNex, EconML)
in python, including tradeoffs/benefits of packages not used for the implementation
of the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a basic API for the pipeline using &lt;code&gt;fastapi&lt;/code&gt;. Verify that it works with
tests. Keep it updated as the pipeline and data change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outcome: gain experience with API implementation and maintenence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a more advanced causal inference pipeline with a real world (or
synthetic approximation) dataset and additional functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outcome: gain knowledge of causal inference techniques and results,
research experience, and development experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;risks-and-mitigation-strategies&#34;&gt;Risks and Mitigation Strategies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overwhelming theoretical background&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will mitigate this by completing a &amp;ldquo;minimum viable&amp;rdquo; pipeline and API before
implementing more advanced techniques.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problems with data, verification of model performance, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will use a dataset that is tailored for this problem and has had prior
research done on it rather than try to solve a novel problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unforseen difficulty with API, testing, tools, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As said above, I am not setting my research goals too high because I know that
a large part of this project will be about learning methods and tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;assessments&#34;&gt;Assessments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the weekly writeups, deliver:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;survey of causal reasoning python packages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;causal inference pipeline developed with a complex real world or synthetic
dataset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;working API access to pipeline with documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I researched the available causal reasoning packages for Python, primarily DoWhy, CausalNex, EconML, as well as some preliminary research into more specialized packages such as scikit-uplift. I also researched available datasets related to the field. Most of the datasets are related to econometrics or medical outcomes, expectedly. I learned that some of the datasets available on PhysioNet require credentialled access, and I’m unsure if I would be able to (or if it would even be worth it) to acquire it for this class. I wrote and posted my project proposal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;My personal website is up at leonorae.github.io, but I need to add more of the required pages, which I will work on this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I will also do some &amp;ldquo;hello world&amp;rdquo; type examples with the packages mentioned above as well as some groundwork theoretical research and present some examples from both in a post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main impediments at this time are organizational, I need to outline my time and schedule around heavy weeks in Systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can improve my process this week by organizing my time in regards to working on my project and doing &amp;ldquo;logistical&amp;rdquo; things such as reflecting on my work in posts more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I worked on conceptualizing a project idea, setting up my personal website, and researching the current state of causal inference techniques and libraries. My main struggle with finding a project has been balancing my desire to do open-ended research with the need to create a tangible result which demonstrates my skills. In my introduction post I mentioned my interest in causality, and Professor Guinn suggested a project to create a causal inference pipeline with a library such as DoWhy or CausalNex with a public dataset and make it available as an API-based web service.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;This week I worked on conceptualizing a project idea, setting up my personal website, and researching the current state of causal inference techniques and libraries. My main struggle with finding a project has been balancing my desire to do open-ended research with the need to create a tangible result which demonstrates my skills. In my introduction post I mentioned my interest in causality, and Professor Guinn suggested a project to create a causal inference pipeline with a library such as DoWhy or CausalNex with a public dataset and make it available as an API-based web service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like this idea a lot, because it has a good balance of theoretical interest with practicality, as well as a balance of demonstrating/reinforcing skills I have acquired as part of this program with learning new ones. I have created similar models in the Machine Learning class, have used Flask in the Software Development class, etc. but I have not combined the two nor have I done extensive API design. I also like that the minimum viable product seems very attainable, which gives me space to do research on the side and really gain a deep understanding of how the model I create works and experiment with various parameters and techniques. I could also do something like extending the baseline functionality of the API with a natural language interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main challenge I face now is finding a good dataset for the project. In ML I found the majority of publicly available datasets lacking. My interest is in the model architecture itself less than any particular domain, so I will ultimately be looking for something that seems the most likely to contain interesting causal relationships that could be queried. I think I will focus my search on healthcare data first as there is a sizeable medical technology presence in my area and it is a well known application of causal inference and expert system technologies. I may also look into economic data, as the field of econometrics is closely related to ML/causality theory. I am also aware that I do not necessarily have to commit to a single data source at the outset of or for the whole duration of the project, so whatever area I choose I will probably use a smaller dataset or subset while I design the overall pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides looking for potential datasets, this week I need to survey the libraries I will use to implement the model (DoWhy, CausalNex, EconML, scipy/statsmodels, &amp;hellip;?) and web service (Flask/FastAPI, others?). Again I do not think that I have to make a final decision immediately, but rather experiment with all options that seem reasonable and document my findings. From there I should be in a good position to make a decision as my project&amp;rsquo;s subject and goals become more clear. While I know that I work best with a relatively open and flexible approach, I do think that I need to add some structure to my work going forward as compared to this last week. By the end of next week I should also have some general outline of the weekly schedule and deadlines for myself, but allow room for adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;
