## About
My main areas of interest in computing include artificial intelligence and programming languages.

## Education
I am currently studying Computer Science at the University of Colorado, Boulder's Postbaccelaureate degree program, and plan to graduate at the end of 2025.

I previously studied and earned a bachelor's degree in Music at the University of California, Riverside.

## Technical
I have experience with a variety of programming languages. I have done the majority of my coursework and personal programming in Python. I enjoy using Common Lisp for personal projects as well.

I have used these languages as part of a course, but have limited experience using them for projects:
- C/C++
- Scala
- Ruby
- Racket/Scheme
- SML
