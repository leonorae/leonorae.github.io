### This Week
- I created a basic inference pipeline with the DoWhy tutorial
- I implemented a basic API with the fastAPI tutorial and made the results from the DoWhy tutorial accessible
- I added a navigation menu and about page to my personal website, and some other minor updates
- I added three posts containing the information I have compended so far on causal inference resources to make my research visible:
  - Learning resources (books, tutorials, papers)
  - Datasets
  - Python packages (will include personal thoughts and comparisons as I develop them)
- Learned important causal inference concepts, fundamental formulae (association vs. causation, bias, etc.), differences between methodologies and tasks

### Next Week
- choose testing framework and write initial tests
- start exploring toy datasets and more interesting inference tasks, choose main dataset to focus on
- draft plan for API design
- refine resource pages, as right now they are drafts/lists
- create structured learning plan (identify vital/fundamental study topics)

### Impediments
I spent more time than I expected to with the venv setup and dependency problems, but this was a good opportunity to learn more about eg. setting up a pyproject.toml file. I ran into a seemingly unresolvable dependency issue between CausalNex and DoWhy. I have decided to leave causalnex to the side for now, as dowhy seems more useful and important to understand. I will still investigate it in a different virtual environment and write some of my thoughts on how it compares to dowhy, but I will use this as an opportunity to focus the scope of my project.

As I expected, the subject matter is complex and fully understanding all of the material within the semester is not feasible. I spent a lot of time this week in introductory subject material, I believe this was a good idea because of the importance of fundamental knowledge, but it is not sustainable to treat this project like a full causal inference class. My structured learning plan will help me stay focused and only devote significant time to learning things I really need to understand for this project.

### Process
I feel better and better about my process as I become more organized and the scope narrows. I still need to define the endpoint of my project more, but I think that will be very possible this week. I think this week I will dive into the code a bit more before reading too much theory and try to "backfill" my understanding after implementing something to avoid getting stuck trying to fully understand something's implementation details.
