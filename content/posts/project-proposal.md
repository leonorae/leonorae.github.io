# Project Proposal
## Causal Inference Pipeline with API
### Vision Statement
Causal inference is a technique that is important in the history of artificial
intelligence. It is interested in finding causes and effects from data and
constructing causal models. It is a difficult problem for many reasons, including
the classic "coorelation does not imply causation" problem. A ground truth is often
difficult to find, and experimenting/gathering many kinds of data can be difficult
or impossible.
It is related to the field of econometrics, and is important to the medical field
in assessing causes of patient outcomes.
I would like to explore the current state of the field using Python libraries,
developing a basic pipeline and experimenting with various techniques and datasets,
and ultimately deliver a functional API.
### Motivation
I would like to learn more about Bayes Nets and causal theory while gaining
practical software development experience. I would like to gain an understanding of
the available python packages related to these topics and be able to explain their
differences and compatabilities. I need to gain experience with project design and
management. I think it will be a good experience to document my project as I work
on it.
### Goals / Milestones
- Implement a basic causal inference pipeline with example data using causal
inference python packages. Document experience and reasoning for choices.
- Outcome: gain knowledge of the state of existing causal inference packages
(egs. DoWhy, CausalNex, EconML)
in python, including tradeoffs/benefits of packages not used for the implementation
of the project.
- Create a basic API for the pipeline using `fastapi`. Verify that it works with
tests. Keep it updated as the pipeline and data change.
- Outcome: gain experience with API implementation and maintenence.
- Develop a more advanced causal inference pipeline with a real world (or
synthetic approximation) dataset and additional functionality.
- Outcome: gain knowledge of causal inference techniques and results,
research experience, and development experience.
### Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- Overwhelming theoretical background
- I will mitigate this by completing a "minimum viable" pipeline and API before
implementing more advanced techniques.
- Problems with data, verification of model performance, etc.
- I will use a dataset that is tailored for this problem and has had prior
research done on it rather than try to solve a novel problem.
- Unforseen difficulty with API, testing, tools, etc.
- As said above, I am not setting my research goals too high because I know that
a large part of this project will be about learning methods and tools.
### Assessments
In addition to the weekly writeups, deliver:
- survey of causal reasoning python packages
- causal inference pipeline developed with a complex real world or synthetic
dataset
- working API access to pipeline with documentation
