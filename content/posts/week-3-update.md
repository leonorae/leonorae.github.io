I researched the available causal reasoning packages for Python, primarily DoWhy, CausalNex, EconML, as well as some preliminary research into more specialized packages such as scikit-uplift. I also researched available datasets related to the field. Most of the datasets are related to econometrics or medical outcomes, expectedly. I learned that some of the datasets available on PhysioNet require credentialled access, and Iâ€™m unsure if I would be able to (or if it would even be worth it) to acquire it for this class. I wrote and posted my project proposal.

My personal website is up at leonorae.github.io, but I need to add more of the required pages, which I will work on this week.

This week I will also do some "hello world" type examples with the packages mentioned above as well as some groundwork theoretical research and present some examples from both in a post.

My main impediments at this time are organizational, I need to outline my time and schedule around heavy weeks in Systems.

I can improve my process this week by organizing my time in regards to working on my project and doing "logistical" things such as reflecting on my work in posts more efficiently.
