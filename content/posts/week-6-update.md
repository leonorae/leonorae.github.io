# Week 6 Update
## This Week
- Decided on pytest for testing framework. Refamiliarized self with pytest and created initial test stub.
- Refined scope of project to basic inference topics with a focus on causal discovery methods
- Began design of discovery API with plans for data validation with Pydantic
- Implementated basic discovery method for data pairs (ie. given the assumption that one variable is causal and one is an effect, which one is which? and give measures of certainty)
- Added to learning resources page

## Next Week
- experiment with causal discovery algorithms on more complex datasets
- formalize API design more and begin documentation
- add more methods/library choices to API
- write more extensive tests

## Impediments and Process
I got more done this week by focusing on learning about high-level practical tasks above theoretical knowledge or implementation details. I do feel as though I lack some understanding of the things I implemented through library APIs, so I would not really feel confident asserting anything in particular about the results I am acheiving. I do feel like this is worthwhile though, as having a tangible program starting to take shape acts as motivation to go back and learn in more detail what it is doing and how I can refine and improve the results.
